## FIR Filters

FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters are basic digital filters with a limited number of coefficients. Key characteristics include:

  Stable: They always produce stable outputs.
  
  Linear Phase: They can keep the phase of the signal unchanged, preventing distortion.
  
  Easy to Implement: Generally straightforward to design and use.

### Uses

  Audio equalization
  
  Removing noise from signals

## IIR Filters

IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filters are more complex and can have feedback loops. Key characteristics include:

  Potentially Unstable: They can become unstable if not designed carefully.
  
  Not Linear Phase: They may distort the phase of signals.
  
  More Efficient: Often need fewer coefficients to achieve similar effects as FIR filters.

## Uses

  Audio processing
  
  Signal filtering in communications
